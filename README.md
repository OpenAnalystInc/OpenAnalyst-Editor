## Prerequisites

In order to download necessary tools, clone the repository, and install dependencies via npm, you need network access.

**Note:** You should clone into a path WITHOUT spaces to avoid issues when compiling native modules.

You'll need the following tools:

- **Git**
- **Node.JS**, x64 or ARM64, version >=20.x (also see .nvmrc)
  - If using nvm, consider updating your default node installation with `nvm alias default <VERSION>`
  - Windows: do not pick the option to install Windows Build Tools
  - Windows: If using nvm-windows on ARM64, you must postfix each command with arm64. Eg: `nvm install 22 arm64`
- **Python** (required for node-gyp; check the node-gyp readme for supported versions)
  - Make sure python can run from command line without error
  - Install setuptools package: `pip install setuptools`
- **C/C++ compiler tool chain** for your platform:

### Windows 10/11 (x64 or ARM64)
- Install Visual C++ Build Tools or Visual Studio Community Edition
- Minimum workload: "Desktop Development with C++"
- Additional components needed:
  - MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (Latest)
  - C++ ATL for latest build tools with Spectre Mitigations
  - C++ MFC for latest build tools with Spectre Mitigations
  - Windows on ARM only: Windows 10 SDK (10.0.20348.0)
- Run `npm config edit` and set `msvs_version=2022`

### macOS
- Xcode and Command Line Tools
- Run `xcode-select --install`

### Linux
- **Debian-based**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev libsecret-1-dev libkrb5-dev python-is-python3`
- **Red Hat-based**: `sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" && sudo yum install libX11-devel.x86_64 libxkbfile-devel.x86_64 libsecret-devel krb5-devel`

## Build and Run

### Getting the sources
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenAnalystInc/OpenAnalyst-Editor.git
cd OpenAnalyst-Editor
```

### Build
Install and build all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then choose one of:
- **From OpenAnalyst-Editor**: Open the OpenAnalyst-Editor folder and press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (macOS: `CMD+Shift+B`)
- **From Terminal**: Run `npm run watch`

The incremental builder will do an initial full build and display "Finished compilation" when ready.

### Run Commands

#### Desktop Version
**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/code.sh
./scripts/code-cli.sh  # for CLI commands
```

**Windows:**
```bat
.\scripts\code.bat
.\scripts\code-cli.bat
```

#### Web Version
**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/code-web.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bat
.\scripts\code-web.bat
```

**Note:** Also run `npm run watch-web` to build web bits for built-in extensions.

#### Code Server Web
**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
./scripts/code-server.sh --launch
```

**Windows:**
```bat
.\scripts\code-server.bat --launch
```

### Troubleshooting
- Clone into a path without spaces
- If issues persist, delete `~/.node-gyp` contents and run `git clean -xfd`
- Windows: Use x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017/2022
- Linux: May hit ENOSPC error - check Common Questions for solutions
